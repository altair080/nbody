nbody is a simple n-body code written in C, parallelized with OpenMP for shared-memory systems and 
utilizing the SDL2 library for graphical output, making it a handy tool to run interactive 
n-body simulations for both scientific and educational purposes.

### How to get started ###
Download the repository zip, unpack the archive, open a terminal and type "make".
The GNU C compiler gcc, SDL2 and SDL2_ttf must be present.

### A local SDL2 installation ###
In case you don't have root priviliges on your machine, the SDL2 library can be installed locally to your home directory.

1. Download the SDL2 source code from https://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL2-2.0.7.zip

2. Unzip it in your home directory

3. Open a console and change to the SDL2-2.0.7 directory

4. Run the configure script: ./configure --prefix=$HOME

5. Compile it: make

6. Install it: make install

Repeat the whole procedere for the SDL2_ttf library:

1. Download the SDL2_ttf source code from
https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/release/SDL2_ttf-2.0.14.zip

2. Unzip it in your home directory

3. Open a console and change to the newly created directory SDL2_ttf-2.0.14

4. Run the configure script: ./configure --prefix=$HOME

5. Compile it: make

6. Install it: make install

You'll find three new folders in your home directory (bin, lib, share) which shouldn't mess up too much.
As a final step, you should add the new library directories to your .bashrc:

1. Open a console in your home directory
2. Type: gedit .bashrc
3. Append the following lines:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/lib
export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"

4. Save the file, close gedit and close the terminal.


### Running a simulation ###
At this very early stage of the project, both the settings and the simulation setup are hard-coded in the setup.c module. 
The main program calls the "init_bodies" routine that can be found and modified in the setup.c file. 
For a quick start, simply call one of the example setups you can find in the examples.c file. 
A full description on how to get started will be provided with the first official release of the code.
